  "description": "Thank you so much for all the hard work you put into the project conducted by batch of ’15. Your 3d rendering skills are remarkable and the whole project was a success because of the vizualization you brought foward. The interior design and the 3D structure is better than I have seen in many other attempts at similar projects and the audience who viewed it was also thoroughly impressed."
